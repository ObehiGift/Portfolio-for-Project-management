# üèó Building a Dream: My Journey Managing a 2-Bedroom Bungalow Project
As an aspiring project manager with a background in civil engineering, I set out to simulate a real-world construction project from scratch, building a 2-bedroom bungalow. The goal? To understand every stage of a project lifecycle and demonstrate my ability to plan, manage, and deliver.

This portfolio captures how i applied real-world project management tools, methodologies, and decision-making frameworks across multiple project stages. From planning and budgeting to execution, this journey demonstrates my ability to manage complexity while remaining outcome-driven.

## üîéPhase 1: Why Build?
Every project needs a strong foundation, not just physically, but strategically. In this phase I crafted a [Business Case](https://github.com/ObehiGift/Portfolio-for-Project-management/blob/main/Business%20Case.pdf) that justified the need for the bungalow. I analyzed the potential use cases, estimated high-level costs and potentail alternatives.
This helped clarify:
- The project's objectives
- Expected benefits
- Return of income

## üëìPhase 2: Scoping the Vision
Defining clear boundaries prevents project creep and misalignment. I created a [Scope Statement](https://github.com/ObehiGift/Portfolio-for-Project-management/blob/main/Scope%20Statement.pdf) outlining:
- Deliverables
- In-scope and out-of-scope work
- Constraints
- Acceptance criteria
- Timeline overview

This acted as a contract between the 'client' and the 'project team' keeping everyone aligned from day one.

## üß±Phase 3: Breaking it Down
To avoid getting overwhelmed, I broke the project into manageable components using a [Work Breakdown Structure(WBS)](https://github.com/ObehiGift/Portfolio-for-Project-management/blob/main/Work%20Breakdown%20Structure.pdf). This included high-level phases such as:
- Site Preparation
- Structural Work
- Roofing
- Finishing and Handover

Each phase was further decomposed into smaller tasks and deliverables, making it easier to assign resources, estimate time, and track progress.

## üïíPhase 4: Planning the Work
Once the scope and tasks were defined, I created a [Project Plan](https://github.com/ObehiGift/Portfolio-for-Project-management/blob/main/Project%20Plan.pdf) that outlined each stages showing the objective, key activities, deliverables, duration, parties involved and the criteria for success in each stage of the project. I also used Microsoft Project to plan the schedule and set dependencies. I created an [Activity Plan](https://github.com/ObehiGift/Portfolio-for-Project-management/blob/main/Activity.mpp) which mapped out all project activities, logically sequenced by construction stage (site prep, foundation, structural work, finishing etc.). The [Gantt Chart](https://github.com/ObehiGift/Portfolio-for-Project-management/blob/main/Gantt%20Chart.xlsx) will show the how my project flows from start to finish. Where dates of each activity is visually shown and which activities run simultaneously.

## üí∞Phase 5: Budgeting
Construction plan can easily go over budget, so i created a [Budget Plan](https://github.com/ObehiGift/Portfolio-for-Project-management/blob/main/Budget%20Plan.pdf) which estimated project costs using a summarized budget covering
- Materials
- Labor
- Equipment
- Contingency

## üìàPhase 6: Project Monitoring
Montoting the progress of a project is key to determining if the project is behinf schedule or on schedule. To monitor progress, i built a [Project Tracker](https://github.com/ObehiGift/Portfolio-for-Project-management/blob/main/Project%20tracker.xlsx) that marks each phase as complete, in-progress or not started. This tool helped simulate real-world project monitoring.

## üõ†Tools Used
- **Microsoft Project** - For scheduling and timelines
- **Microsoft Word** - For reports and documentation
- **Excel** - For tracking progress
- **Markdown and Github** - For presenting the project in a clean and accessible format

## üöÄWhat This Project Demonstrate
- My ability to **plan and organize** a construction project from start to finish
- Competence in using **professional tools** like MS projec and Excel
- Understanding of **key PM concepts** like scope, scheduling and tracking
- Initiative and **self-driven learning** in simulating a real-world project independently
