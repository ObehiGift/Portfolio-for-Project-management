# üèó Building a Dream: My Journey Managing a 2-Bedroom Bungalow Project
As an aspiring project manager with a background in civil engineering, I set out to simulate a real-world construction project from scratch, building a 2-bedroom bungalow. The goal? To understand every stage of a project lifecycle and demonstrate my ability to plan, manage, and deliver.

This portfolio captures how i applied real-world project management tools, methodologies, and decision-making frameworks across multiple project stages. From planning and budgeting to execution, this journey demonstrates my ability to manage complexity while remaining outcome-driven.

## üîéPhase 1: Why Build?
Every project needs a strong foundation, not just physically, but strategically. In this phase I crafted a [Business Case](https://github.com/ObehiGift/Portfolio-for-Project-management/blob/main/Business%20Case.pdf) that justified the need for the bungalow. I analyzed the potential use cases, estimated high-level costs and potentail alternatives.
This helped clarify:
- The project's objectives
- Expected benefits
- Return of income

## üëìPhase 2: Scoping the Vision
Defining clear boundaries prevents project creep and misalignment. I created a [Scope Statement](https://github.com/ObehiGift/Portfolio-for-Project-management/blob/main/Scope%20Statement.pdf) outlining:
- Deliverables
- In-scope and out-of-scope work
- Constraints
- Acceptance criteria
- Timeline overview

This acted as a contract between the 'client' and the 'project team' keeping everyone aligned from day one.

## üß±Phase 3: Breaking it Down
To avoid getting overwhelmed, I broke the project into manageable components using a [Work Breakdown Structure(WBS)](https://github.com/ObehiGift/Portfolio-for-Project-management/blob/main/Work%20Breakdown%20Structure.pdf). This included high-level phases such as:
- Site Preparation
- Structural Work
- Roofing
- Finishing and Handover

Each phase was further decomposed into smaller tasks and deliverables, making it easier to assign resources, estimate time, and track progress.

## üïíPlanning the Work
Once the scope and tasks were defined, I created a [Project Plan]() that outlined each stages showing the objective, key activities, deliverables, duration, parties involved and the criteria for success in each stage of the project. I also used Microsoft Project to plan the schedule and set dependencies. I created an [Activity Plan](https://github.com/ObehiGift/Portfolio-for-Project-management/blob/main/Activity.mpp) which mapped out all project activities, logically sequenced by construction stage (site prep, foundation, structural work, finishing etc.). The [Gantt Chart]() will show the how my project flows from start to finish. Where dates of each activity is visually shown and which activities run simultaneously.
